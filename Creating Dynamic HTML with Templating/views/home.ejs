    <h1>Templating</h1>
    <p>Templating is a technique used in programming where predefined structures, placeholders, or templates are used to generate dynamic content. These templates often contain variables or markers that are replaced with actual data at runtime, allowing developers to separate content from the layout. Templating is especially useful in web development, where HTML templates can be reused with different data sets.</p>
    <h2>Key Concepts of Templating:</h2>
    <p>Separation of Logic and Design: Templating separates the application logic from the presentation layer (UI), making the code easier to manage and maintain.
        Placeholders: Templates use placeholders for dynamic content. These placeholders get replaced with actual data when the template is rendered.
        Reusability: Templates can be reused across different parts of an application or even different applications, reducing redundancy.
        Data Binding: Templates bind data dynamically, allowing for the display of variable content without changing the structure.</p>
